# Hyperledger Sawtooth SDK

*Hyperledger Sawtooth* is an enterprise solution for building, deploying, and
running distributed ledgers (also called blockchains). It provides an
extremely modular and flexible platform for implementing transaction-based
updates to shared state between untrusted parties coordinated by consensus
algorithms.

The *Sawtooth CXX SDK* provides a number of useful components that simplify
developing CXX applications which interface with the Sawtooth platform.
For full usage and installation instructions please reference the
official Sawtooth documentation below:
